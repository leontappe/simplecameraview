# simplecameraview

no bullshit allowed camera view since I don't want to pay 3$ for a stupid simple camera view app just so I can get a clean camera feed from my old iPhone

## Features
- Camera view
- You look at the world through your camera
- You can see objects just like your phone would see them!

_Wow_

### Update:

I started adding easy features, all of them kind of work in progress:

 - Zoom
 - Focus Lock
 - Exposure Offset
 - Video stream settings (none so far)
   - FPS
   - Resolution
   - Bitrate
 - Still no recording lol
